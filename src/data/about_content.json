    "desc": "I am a full-stack web developer and student with a strong interest in building modern, reliable web applications while continuously learning new technologies. My current focus is on developing projects using React and Vite for the frontend, combined with TypeScript to write clean and maintainable code. On the backend, I work with Node.js and Express, and I have experience designing and interacting with relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. As a student, I use this portfolio to document my learning journey and showcase the projects I build along the way. Each project represents practical experimentation with real-world development concepts, including application structure, API design, and database integration. I am currently focused on improving my full-stack development skills by building projects from scratch and exploring best practices in modern web development. This portfolio serves as a place to track progress, share work, and apply what I learn through hands-on experience."
